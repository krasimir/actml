> You know what I really like in React - it teaches you how to build well encapsulated components that are also highly composable. The thing is that React and its JSX is for our UI. It is a view layer that renders stuff on the screen. I want something similar but for my business logic. Sometimes that allows me to use the same patterns but helps me deal with the asynchronous nature of the front-end development. So, I did it. Meet *ActML* - like React but for your business logic.
